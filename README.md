# IMDB_Text-Sentiment-Analysis


# üß† Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Overviews
This project builds a sentiment analysis model using IMDB movie overviews to classify each description as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content.

 # üìå Task Description
The main objective was to implement a machine learning model for sentiment classification, including:

Text Preprocessing: Lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Feature Engineering: Text was converted into numerical format using TF-IDF.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression classifier was trained on the cleaned text data.

Model Evaluation: Performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score.

 # üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
Pandas, NumPy for data handling

NLTK for natural language preprocessing

TextBlob for sentiment polarity scoring

Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

 # üìä Model Performance
The model was evaluated on a holdout test set. Below is a snapshot of its performance:

# The model performs best on positive and negative reviews, while neutral sentiment is more challenging to classify ‚Äî likely due to subtler language cues and fewer samples.
